This is my internship data cleaning repository

## Data Cleaning Breakdowm

- I got the original xls and xlsx files and converted them to csv files
  (Coversion was done from [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/xlsx-to-csv))
- I then used the csv files to create a database which is in the datasets folder
- based on these datasets, I created a Pythin Script to clean the data and create a new database file labelled template.csv in the root folder to hold the cleaned data
